    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Combine beef strips and 2 tablespoons cornstarch in a bowl; toss until beef strips are evenly coated. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                To make sauce, stir 1/4 cup reserved pineapple juice, beef broth, soy sauce, rice vinegar, and sambal oelek or Sriracha together 
                in a bowl; set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add beef and onion to the hot oil, and cook, stirring quickly and 
                constantly, until beef is browned, about 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in carrots, snow peas, and bell pepper; cook and stir about 1 minute. Add garlic and ginger and cook about 30 seconds. Stir 
                in reserved sauce and pineapple chunks.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir remaining cornstarch with 2 tablespoons water and add to the skillet. Cook, stirring constantly, until sauce is thickened, 1 
                to 2 minutes more.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve immediately with hot cooked rice, garnished with fresh chives, if desired.
