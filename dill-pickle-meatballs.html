        pickle-inspired meatballs are a perfectly craveable twist on the classic dish.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Gather all ingredients. Generously spray a large rimmed baking sheet with cooking spray.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add beef, cracker crumbs, onion, egg, garlic powder, black pepper, 1/2 cup feta, chopped dill pickles, 4 tablespoons pickle 
                juice, 1/2 cup herbs, and 1 teaspoon salt to a large bowl; stir gently using a fork or clean hands until just combined, being 
                sure not to overwork meat. Cover and chill in the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes or up to 12 hours. The meatballs are 
                easiest to form when cold.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) with rack in top third position.
            </li>
            <li>
                Roll beef mixture into 24 (about 1 1/4 ounce; 1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons) meatballs. Arrange meatballs on the prepared 
                baking sheet evenly spaced apart.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Increase oven temperature to broil, do not remove meatballs from oven. Broil until 
                tops are browned and meatballs are cooked through, about 6 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                While meatballs bake, whisk together yogurt, remaining 1 tablespoon pickle juice, remaining 1/4 cup herbs, and remaining 1/4 
                teaspoon salt in a small bowl until combined.
            </li>
            <li>
                Divide buttered rice among 4 plates. Top evenly with meatballs and remaining 1/2 cup feta cheese. Serve with yogurt sauce and 
                garnish with pepper and herbs.
            </li>
        </ol>
